These application are:
 * great for improving your coding skills;
 * great for experimenting with new technologies;
 * great for adding to your portfolio to impress yor next employer/client;
 * great for using as examples in tutorials (articles or videos);
 * easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features;

 This is not just a simple list of projects, but a collection
 that describes each project in enough detail so tha you can
 develop it from the ground up!

 Each project has the following features:
 1. A clear end descripive objective;
 2. A list of User Stories which should be implemented (these stories act more as a
 guidekine than a forced lis of To-Do's. Feel free to add your own stories if you
 want);
 3. A list of bonus feature that noy only improve the base project, but also your skills 
 at the same time (these are optional and should be attempted only after you have
 completed the required user stories).
 4. All the resouces and links to help you find what you need to complete the project
